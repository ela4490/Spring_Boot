### Spring Boot with Eureka Server
Eureka is a Service Registry which registers all your micro services with Eureka server.
This means that there is no need to call each service by passing exact URL like host name, port number. 
Just give your service name with which you have registered with Eureka server and just add endpoint URL.
This is a demo project which shows how this can be achieved in a spring boot application.
